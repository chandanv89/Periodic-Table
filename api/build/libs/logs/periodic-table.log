Three isotopes occur naturally, <span><sup>12</sup>C</span> and <span><sup>13</sup>C</span> being stable, while <span><sup>14</sup>C</span> is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.</p>"}

It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and Jupiter, because of the very high nuclear binding energy of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay.
